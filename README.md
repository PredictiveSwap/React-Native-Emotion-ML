### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

## 🧠 How It Works

### Facial Analysis
The app uses the device's camera to detect facial expressions and map them to emotional states. It analyzes features like smiles, eyebrow position, and more to determine if you're happy, sad, surprised, or neutral.

### Voice Analysis
By analyzing pitch, tone, and rhythm of speech, the app can identify emotional undertones in your voice recordings.

### Text Analysis
The app performs sentiment analysis on text entries to determine emotional content, identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
